# HBNB Project

## Introduction

This repository contains the HBNB (Holberton Bed and Breakfast) project, a school assignment designed to demonstrate proficiency in software architecture, design principles, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Python.

## Project Overview

The HBNB project aims to create a simplified Airbnb-like application. It involves designing and implementing a system that manages various entities such as Users, Places, Reviews, and Amenities.

## Structure

### High-Level Architecture
The project follows a three-layer architecture:
- **Presentation Layer**: Handles user interactions and exposes APIs.
- **Business Logic Layer**: Contains the core business logic and models for the system.
- **Persistence Layer**: Responsible for data storage and retrieval.

### Key Components
- **Users**: Represents the users of the system.
- **Places**: Represents the places listed on the platform.
- **Reviews**: Represents the reviews left by users for places.
- **Amenities**: Represents the amenities available at places.

## UML Diagrams

### Package Diagram
A high-level package diagram illustrating the system's architecture and dependencies between layers.


```scss
+--------------------+
|   E-Commerce App   |
+--------------------+
|     +-------+      |
|     |Orders |      |
|     +-------+      |
|     +-------+      |
|     |Payments      |
|     +-------+      |
|     +-------+      |
|     |Shipping|     |
|     +-------+      |
+--------------------+
        |
        |
        v
+--------------------+
|      Database      |
+--------------------+
```

### Class Diagram
A detailed class diagram showing the classes, attributes, methods, and relationships within the Business Logic layer.


```scss
+---------------+          +-------------+          +--------------+
|   PetShop     |<>------->|    Pet      |<>------->|   Owner      |
+---------------+          +-------------+          +--------------+
| - location    |          | - name      |          | - name       |
| - inventory   |          | - species   |          | - contactInfo|
+---------------+          | - age       |          +--------------+
| + addPet()    |          +-------------+          | + adoptPet() |
| + removePet() |          | + feed()    |          +--------------+
+---------------+          | + play()    | 
                           +-------------+
```

### Sequence Diagrams
Sequence diagrams for key API operations such as User Registration, Place Creation, Review Submission, and Fetching a List of Places.


```scss
         Customer       Restaurant
           |               |
           |     placeOrder()
           |--------------->|
           |               |  processOrder()
           |<---------------| 
           |               |   prepareOrder()
           |<---------------|
           |     deliverOrder()
           |--------------->|
           |               |   receiveOrder()
           |<---------------|
```

## Installation and Usage

### Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:
```bash
