# HBNB Project - Part 1 -

## Current Task: 0. High-Level Package Diagram 

### Date: 03/10/2024

#### Status:
- **Task Description:**  Creating the **Package** UML diagram to illustrates the three-layer architecture of the HBnB application and the communication between these layser via the **facade pattern**.

- **Before starting:** After some issues to manages both weekly tasks and the group project, I browsed through all the documentation to acquire a good grasp about UML diagrams and how to build them. For now my knowledge is mainly theorical and I have to put it now in practice. 

#### Challenges/Blockers:
- **Current Challenges:** I stayed a lot on the theorical part and thus, as for each project, the turn between theorical and practical can be difficult and often blocked me a bit.
- **Potential Solutions:** *"Try, die and retry"* Which means really trying to do something, trying to **not** expect it to be perfect already and then reffactore it until satisfaction.

#### Notes:
- **Ideas:** Using Visual paradigm instead of mermaid, more user friendly and visual
- **Questions:** 
- **Reminders:** Stop overthinking.

#### To-Do List:
- [x] Creating a poor draft
- [x] Creating just the bare potential squeleton
- [x] Check with other if on the right track
- [x] Identify the whole "things" I have to put inside
- [x] Refactoring the diagram to something better

## Notes during process:

I needed a lot of time to process my thoughts to actually try the first draft. Even if I already did researches and documentation I felt the need to go further in the specific point of the **layer** structure and **facade pattern**. Once donce, I used an already existing template for basic layered package diagram on Visual Paradigm and changed everything to match my project.

Due to personnal taste, I decided to kinda give a "waterfall" aspect of the whole diagram. Even if it is in **package** format I still organised it to work with the **"starting point"** (`User`) and going down until the **deepest layer** and components (`Data`).

I still have a lot to do, filling each layer and components of these layers with what I already know but I let space to be able to change and adapt.
